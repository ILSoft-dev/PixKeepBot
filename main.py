v5.12 - CleanDrive Bot (multi-user, multi-account, Google Drive backend, admin-only)

Changelog:
- v5.12: the upload flow used to always end with a routine "🗑 Удалил N
        исходных сообщений из чата" text message AFTER the "✅ Загружено...
        ссылка" report — so the link/report was never actually the last
        thing visible in the chat. Deleting the original messages now just
        runs under the same TYPING chat-action indicator as the rest of the
        pipeline (v5.11) instead of narrating itself with its own message.
        A text message only appears afterward if something genuinely needs
        attention — a handful of messages Telegram wouldn't let get deleted
        (e.g. too old) — since that's information the person has to act on,
        not a routine confirmation. When everything deletes cleanly (the
        normal case), the upload report stays the last word in the chat.
- v5.11: moved the "still working" indicator (v5.9) out of the chat log and
        into Telegram's native chat-action line — the "бот отправляет
        файл..." text that shows right under the chat title, the same spot
        Telegram's own service notices ("Connecting...") show up. v5.9 sent
        random filler text messages into the conversation itself to prove
        the bot hadn't stalled; those are gone now in favor of
        bot.send_chat_action, re-sent every 4s (a chat action only holds
        for ~5s before Telegram clears it) for as long as the wrapped work
        runs, then left to disappear on its own — nothing to clean up.
        Same two spots as before (download+exif+clean in _process, the
        Drive upload in _do_upload), just a different action type per spot
        since Bot API's fixed action vocabulary has no generic "processing"
        option: TYPING for the first, UPLOAD_DOCUMENT (the default) for the
        second.
- v5.10: added a "♻️ Заменять файлы с таким же именем" setting
        (replace_duplicates, /settings — off by default, so nobody's
        existing behavior changes unless they opt in). Google Drive treats
        filenames as plain metadata, not a unique path — uploading a file
        called IMG_1234.jpg into a folder that already has one just creates
        a second object with the same name, no error, no warning. With this
        on, upload now checks the target folder for a file with that exact
        name first (find_file_in_folder) and overwrites its content in
        place (replace_file_content) instead of creating a duplicate —
        same file id, same share link. Matching is by name only within the
        target folder, not by content hash, so this is specifically for
        "I re-sent the same file/named it the same" rather than true
        content-dedup.
        REQUIRES a Supabase migration before deploying — see db.py's
        header (ALTER TABLE user_settings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS
        replace_duplicates boolean default false;) — get_settings() builds
        its SELECT from DEFAULT_SETTINGS.keys(), so without that column
        every call (including the one behind every single upload) errors
        out until the migration runs.
- v5.9: added a "heartbeat" — a background ping every 6s with a random
        working-on-it phrase (see HEARTBEAT_MESSAGES) — wrapped around the
        two stretches of the pipeline that can run long with literally
        nothing printed to the chat: download-from-Telegram + exiftool
        inspect/clean in _process, and the actual Drive upload in
        _do_upload. Purely cosmetic/reassurance — the messages don't need
        to (and don't) describe the exact operation running at that instant,
        they just prove the bot hasn't silently died on a big or slow
        batch. Implemented as an async context manager (_heartbeat) so it
        starts/stops correctly via try/finally regardless of whether the
        wrapped code finishes normally, raises, or (in principle) gets
        cancelled — no separate bookkeeping needed at each call site.
- v5.8: added a "📋 Скопировать ссылку" button under the final upload report,
        using Telegram's copy_text inline-button type (Bot API 7.x+,
        aiogram's CopyTextButton) — tapping it puts the Drive link straight
        on the clipboard. The link in the message text is still a normal
        tappable URL that opens the folder; this is purely additive, since
        Telegram gives a plain URL exactly one tap behavior (open) and
        there's no way to make that same tap also copy.
- v5.7: replaced the two separate, uncoordinated batch-collection mechanisms
        (one waiting a flat 1s for an album's remaining media_group_id
        messages, one debouncing individually-sent files with no
        media_group_id) with a single per-chat buffer + one silence timer
        (BATCH_SILENCE_SECONDS, still 4.0s). Every incoming photo/document
        for a chat — album or not, whichever album — now goes into the same
        list and resets the same timer; processing starts once nothing new
        has arrived for BATCH_SILENCE_SECONDS. This is the real fix for the
        "Получил 2 файл(ов)" / "Получил 9 файл(ов)" double-prompt: Telegram
        caps albums at 10 items, so sending 11 photos gets split client-side
        into a 10-item and a 1-item media group with two different
        media_group_id values, arriving moments apart — the old code had no
        way to know they were part of the same user action and processed
        them as two unrelated batches. Now, as long as the split pieces
        arrive within the same silence window (which they normally do,
        being one client-side send), they're collected and processed
        together as a single batch with a single folder-name question.
        folder_name_queue (v5.6) and chat_locks (v5.5) are both kept as
        fallbacks — they still matter if a burst is large/slow enough to
        genuinely produce two separate silence windows.
- v5.6: fixed a second, separate bug behind the same symptom as v5.5's
        "10 + 1" case: Telegram itself splits any send of 11+ photos into
        separate media groups (a hard 10-item album cap, nothing this bot
        can do about that) — so with auto_date_folder OFF, both batches'
        _process() calls reached the manual "укажите имя папки" prompt in
        quick succession. That prompt stores its batch's items/work_dir in
        FSM state and waits for a text reply — but FSM state is per chat,
        not per batch, so the second batch's state.update_data() silently
        overwrote the first batch's before its question could be answered:
        whichever name got typed only applied to the last batch, and the
        earlier one's downloaded files were orphaned (never uploaded, temp
        dir never cleaned up). Two "Укажите имя папки" prompts appearing
        back-to-back, before there was time to answer either, was the
        visible symptom. Fixed with a small per-chat queue
        (folder_name_queue): if a batch reaches the manual-name prompt while
        another one is already waiting on FSM state, it's queued instead of
        overwriting that state, and gets its own prompt once the batch ahead
        of it is answered (on_folder_name) or cancelled (on_cancel) — both
        now run under the same chat_locks lock from v5.5, so a newly
        arriving batch's _process() can't check-and-overwrite FSM state in
        the middle of that handoff either.
- v5.5: fixed a batch-splitting/duplicate-folder bug: a burst of ~10+ files
        sent close together (esp. over a slow/unstable connection) could get
        chopped into several smaller batches — either because the singles
        debounce (v3.2) timed out between arrivals, or because a real
        media-group and a singles-burst landed in the same chat at once.
        Each batch ran _process()/_do_upload() as an independent asyncio
        task with no coordination between them, so two batches could both
        call ensure_folder() for the SAME auto-date folder name concurrently
        — both search, both find nothing yet (the other hasn't created it
        yet), both create a folder, and you end up with two distinct Drive
        folders sharing the same name and only some of the files in each.
        Fixed by serializing all batch processing per chat behind a lock
        (_get_chat_lock): a new batch (whether from _finish_singles or
        _finish_group) now waits for any batch already in flight for that
        chat to fully finish (download → clean → upload → report → delete)
        before starting. This doesn't stop a burst from still being split
        into multiple batches (see SINGLES_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS below), but it
        guarantees those batches run strictly one after another, so the
        second one's ensure_folder() call will always find the folder the
        first one already created instead of racing to make a duplicate.
        Also raised SINGLES_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS 2.0 -> 4.0 to reduce how often
        a slow upload from the phone (weak signal, large files) creates a
        >2s gap between messages and triggers a premature split in the
        first place.
- v5.4: added /version — replies with the running code's version string.
        Added purely as a deployment diagnostic: several rounds of "the
        feature isn't there" turned out to be Render still running an old
        deploy, indistinguishable from an actual code bug without a way to
        ask the running instance what it actually is. Check /version after
        every deploy going forward.
- v5.3: added auto_date_folder setting (/settings, third checkbox). When on,
        the bot skips the "укажите имя папки" text prompt entirely: it reads
        each file's EXIF capture date (falling back to the Telegram message's
        send time, then to today, if no EXIF date is present), picks one date
        for the whole batch (most common; ties go to the earliest), announces
        "Папка будет создана автоматически: DD.MM.YY", and uploads right away
        — no confirmation click, matching the "remove friction" goal from
        /settings itself. GPS/date extraction reuses the same exiftool pass
        already done for the GPS warning, no extra subprocess calls added.
        Upload+report+cleanup logic extracted into _do_upload() shared by
        both this path and the manual on_folder_name handler.
- v5.2: fixed the long freeze after sending files. Root cause: exiftool
        calls (inspect_metadata / strip_exif) are blocking OS subprocess
        calls; running them directly in an async handler froze the ENTIRE
        bot (no other updates processed) for the full duration. Now offloaded
        via asyncio.to_thread, and downloads / exif calls / Drive uploads all
        run concurrently (bounded by semaphores — DOWNLOAD_CONCURRENCY,
        EXIF_CONCURRENCY, UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY) instead of strictly one-by-one.
        Also added a Telegram command menu (the blue "menu" button) via
        bot.set_my_commands() at startup, listing /start /accounts /settings
        /logout.
- v5.1: added a global IsAdmin filter (dp.message.filter / dp.callback_query.filter)
        so ONLY config.ADMIN_ID can interact with the bot at all — anyone else's
        messages are dropped before reaching any handler, silently. This closes
        the "any stranger who finds the bot can connect their own Google
        account and use our infra/quota" exposure raised earlier.
- v5.0: multiple Google accounts per Telegram user. /start now offers
        "add another account" once one is connected; /accounts lists all
        connected accounts and lets you tap one to make it active (that's
        the one uploads go to). Any Google account can connect — not just
        the one that created the OAuth client — since the app is Published
        (In Production) with a non-sensitive scope, so there's no test-user
        allow-list. Settings (clean/anonymize) are now independent of which
        account is active — one set of preferences per Telegram user.
- v4.1: moved "чистить метаданные?" / "обезличить имена?" out of the
        per-upload flow and into standing settings, toggled anytime via
        /settings (checkboxes, persisted in Supabase). The upload flow is
        now just: files -> folder name -> link. Settings are applied
        automatically and silently (the note before the folder-name prompt
        just states what will happen, doesn't ask).
- v4.0: storage backend Yandex.Disk -> Google Drive. Reason: Yandex forces
        login for public FOLDER links (only individual files are login-free
        by design), which broke the "anyone with the link, no auth" goal.
        Google Drive's "anyone with the link" folder sharing has no such
        restriction. Uses drive.file scope (non-sensitive) via plain REST
        (aiohttp), no Google client libraries needed. App is published
        "In Production" so there's no 100-test-user cap and (to be
        confirmed over the coming week) no 7-day refresh-token expiry.
- v3.5: reverted /space (v3.4) — confirmed live that GET /v1/disk returns
        403 under cloud_api:disk.app_folder scope. Showing quota would
        require broadening to a whole-disk read scope, which isn't worth
        trading away the "bot only sees its own folder" guarantee. Back to
        app_folder-only, no disk-quota command.
- v3.3: added a "❌ Отменить загрузку" button at every step (clean choice,
        rename choice, folder-name prompt). Cancelling wipes any downloaded/
        cleaned temp files and clears FSM state — nothing gets uploaded.
- v3.2: fixed batching for files sent as separate messages (no shared
        media_group_id) — some Telegram clients send multi-file "as
        document" uploads this way instead of a real album. Now buffered
        per-chat with a debounce: each new file resets a short timer, and
        the whole burst is processed together once uploads pause.
- v3.1: per-file tracking (message_id -> path -> upload name -> status).
        Upload continues past individual failures instead of aborting the
        whole batch. Final report lists successes/failures by exact
        filename. Successfully uploaded messages are deleted from the chat
        (Telegram lets bots delete their own incoming private messages);
        deletion failures are reported honestly, not hidden.
- v3.0: storage backend Google Drive -> Yandex.Disk (accessible from BY/CIS).
        Per-user Yandex OAuth tokens (access+refresh) in Supabase, auto-refresh.
- v2.1: optional "обезличить имена" -> rename to 001, 002, 003…
- v2.0: multi-user OAuth, optional cleaning, shareable link.

Flow: files -> (settings applied silently: clean? anonymize names?) ->
folder name -> upload to the active Google account's Drive (per-file,
continue on error) -> report + public link -> delete succeeded messages.

Runs an aiohttp server (OAuth callback + Render port) alongside aiogram polling.
